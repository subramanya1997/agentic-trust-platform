#### Execution Equivalents by Agent Complexity

Your 10,000 ultra-light executions can be used for heavier agents at these conversion rates:

| Agent Type      | Input Tokens | Output Tokens | Cost Ratio | Equivalent Executions |
| --------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| **Ultra-Light** | 10,000       | 2,500         | 1.0x       | **10,000**            |
| **Light**       | 25,000       | 5,000         | 2.2x       | **4,500**             |
| **Medium**      | 50,000       | 10,000        | 4.4x       | **2,250**             |
| **Heavy**       | 100,000      | 25,000        | 10x        | **1,000**             |

### Chat Messages

| Allowance          | 8,000 messages/month                                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Use Cases**      | Agent building, testing, refinement, research        |
| **Average Tokens** | ~5,000 input + 1,500 output per message              |
| **Fair Use**       | Consistent usage patterns; no automated bulk queries |
| **Overage**        | $0.08 per message above 8,000                        |

---

### Tool Executions

| Allowance         | 7,500,000 tool calls/month                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What Counts**   | API calls to integrations (Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, etc.) |
| **Premium Tools** | Search APIs, code execution count as 3x                     |
| **Rate Limit**    | 200,000 calls/hour                                          |

Tool executions are separate from agent executions—agents use tokens for reasoning, tools use API calls for actions.
