### Tool Executions

| Allowance         | 2,500,000 tool calls/month                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What Counts**   | API calls to integrations (Slack, GitHub, Salesforce, etc.) |
| **Premium Tools** | Search APIs, code execution count as 3x                     |
